# Proccess for adding new icons

Our final conclusion and logic for using icons in prifina.
These are similarly design styled icons, and as such we have established the following logic for selecting final icons into blend and Prifina design systems and to our UI style guide:

1. https://iconify.design/icon-sets/fe/ (will be used as primary icon set, but since this is a somewhat limited set, we also need alternative libraries. But we have chosen this as our primary one, to add a touch of more unique brand separation than using most widely used icons like ‘material icons’)

2. https://iconify.design/icon-sets/bx/ (is our secondary set of icons for picking icon where a suitable one is not available from the primary set, except in case the icon in question looks ugly or not consistent in style in context of other icons).

3. https://iconify.design/icon-sets/mdi/ (is the next optional icon set for icons, only to be used unless two prior ones fail to provide a suitable or consistent style icon).

4. Final option is to design our own icon. This may become necessary in places where we need an icon for a more unique and new type of ‘topic representation’ due to the nature of the new field we are creating our service into (i.e. personal data market) where relevant and descriptive icons simply have not been established yet.

These are all part of a great Iconify resource, that has made using these icons as easy as possible for developers and designers alike. Learn more: https://iconify.design

These icons are also made easily available and usable in figma via this plugin: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify
